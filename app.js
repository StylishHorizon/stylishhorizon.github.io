      <details>
        <summary>Will YouTube block my music?</summary>
        <p>It might. If your wedding dance was to <em>The Rolling Stones</em> or <em>Prince</em>, YouTube's robots will hear it. <br><br>
        <strong>Our Solution:</strong> We apply "Stealth Audio Mastering" (micro-pitch shifts) to the streaming version to evade detection. <br><br>
        <strong>The Guarantee:</strong> Even if YouTube mutes the online stream, your downloadable <strong>Master File</strong> will ALWAYS have the original, untouched audio.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- 2. STORAGE -->
      <details>
        <summary>Why don't you offer "Cloud Storage"?</summary>
        <p>Because renting cloud space means you pay rent forever. If you stop paying, they delete your memories.<br><br>
        We believe in <strong>Ownership</strong>. We give you the Master File. You can put it on Google Drive, a NAS, or a USB stick. You own it, not us.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- 3. TECHNICAL -->
      <details>
        <summary>Why 768x576 (or 640x480) resolution?</summary>
        <p><strong>For the Geeks:</strong> MiniDV uses non-square pixels. On modern screens, raw footage looks distorted.<br><br>
        We mathematically correct the geometry to Square Pixels based on the tape origin:<br>
        • <strong>PAL (Europe):</strong> Corrected to 768x576.<br>
        • <strong>NTSC (US/Japan):</strong> Corrected to 640x480.<br><br>
        This ensures faces look natural and circles are actually round, regardless of where the tape was filmed.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why is the file so huge?</summary>
        <p>We deliver in <strong>ProRes LT</strong>. It captures every grain of film without compression artifacts. A 60-minute tape can be 20-30GB.<br><br>
        In the "Signature" tier, we also give you a smaller "Mobile Ready" file for WhatsApp.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why are there black bars on the sides?</summary>
        <p>Old video is square (4:3). Modern TVs are wide (16:9).<br><br>
        <strong>The "Signature" Standard:</strong> We use a technique called <em>"Cinematic Fill"</em> (like Netflix documentaries). We fill the side bars with a blurred, darkened extension of the video. It looks premium and uses the full screen without cutting the image.<br><br>
        <strong>Can you crop to fill?</strong> Yes, we can zoom in to remove the bars, but you will lose about 25% of the image (top and bottom). Heads and feet are often cut off. We advise against it.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- 4. LOGISTICS -->
      <details>
        <summary>How do I send you a 50GB file?</summary>
        <p>Raw video files are huge. Email and WhatsApp won't work.
